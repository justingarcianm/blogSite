##about
* I am a huge Star wars fan. I grew up falling in love with the lucas arts games and finding Star wars: Galaxy of Heroes mobile game added the all star element that I always craved from the epic.

* I found it difficult to search for every site that would give me the extra tips to take my experience to the next level; so I created this site as a hub to connect to all of those sites with ease while creating a community within the site itself.

##under the hood
### Front End
* HTML 5
* Css3 + Materialize css
* Javascript

### Backend
* Node js + express
* MongoDB + mongoose


## Strategy
